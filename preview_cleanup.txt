# Preview of Files for Cleanup

This file lists files that can be safely removed. Review before running cleanup.sh

## Web3Forms Related (if removing)
- Note: Only one reference found in migration (column name only, not active code)
- No active web3forms code found - safe to keep migration as-is

## Test Artifacts (if any)
- Check for: *.log files in tests/ directory
- Check for: temporary test files

## Dormant/Unused Files
- None identified - all files appear to be in use

## Duplicate Files
- None identified

## Old Backup Files
- Check for: *.bak, *.old, *.backup files
- Check for: files with ~ suffix

## Build Artifacts (safe to regenerate)
- node_modules/ (regenerated with npm install)
- vendor/ (regenerated with composer install)
- storage/framework/cache/* (regenerated)
- storage/framework/sessions/* (regenerated)
- storage/framework/views/* (regenerated)
- bootstrap/cache/*.php (regenerated)

## Note
Before deleting anything, ensure:
1. Files are not referenced in code
2. Files are not needed for deployment
3. You have a backup

## Recommended Cleanup (Safe)
Only cache/build artifacts should be cleaned:

```bash
# Clear Laravel caches (safe)
php artisan cache:clear
php artisan config:clear
php artisan route:clear
php artisan view:clear

# Remove node_modules if needed (regenerates with npm install)
# rm -rf node_modules

# Remove vendor if needed (regenerates with composer install)
# rm -rf vendor
```

## Files to Keep
- All migrations (even if they reference web3forms - historical record)
- All models, controllers, views
- All configuration files
- All test files
- All documentation files
